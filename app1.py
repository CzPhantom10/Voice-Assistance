"""Legacy Streamlit UI for the Voice Assistant project.

This file is kept for historical reference only. The primary,
product-level implementation now lives in the CLI application
under the ``voice_assistant`` package.

To run the new assistant, use:

    python -m voice_assistant.main

The Streamlit implementation below has been intentionally removed
to avoid confusion and duplicated logic. All new development should
target the CLI architecture.
